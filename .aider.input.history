+Code the following app
+```
+Build a mini-app called “Typhoon Ready: Damage Estimator.”
+This app should quickly estimate a household’s risk level during a typhoon based on simple user inputs.
+
+Follow these requirements exactly:
+
+GENERAL RULES
+
+Use the minimal number of screens (1–2 screens only).
+
+Do NOT generate unnecessary components or pages.
+
+Make the app simple, clean, and fool-proof.
+
+Every input must be validated.
+
+All logic must be easy to understand and impossible to break.
+
+MAIN FLOW
+Screen 1: “Risk Estimator” Form
+Include these input fields:
+
+House Type (Dropdown): Wood, Cement, Mixed, Light Materials
+
+Nearby Hazards (Multi-select checkboxes): Tall trees, Power lines, River/Coast, Loose debris, Open field, None
+
+Roof Condition (Dropdown): Good, Average, Old/Damaged
+
+Past Flood Height (Dropdown): None, Below ankle, Knee-high, Waist-high
+
+Expected Wind Speed (Number input in km/h)
+
+Add a button: “Calculate Risk”
+
+SCREEN 2: Results Page
+Display:
+
+Overall Risk Level: Low / Moderate / High / Severe
+
+Short explanation why
+
+Recommended actions
+
+A simple checklist
+
+RISK CALCULATION LOGIC
+Use a POINT SYSTEM:
+
+House Type: Wood +3, Light Materials +4, Mixed +2, Cement +1
+
+Hazards: Each selected hazard +1
+
+Roof Condition: Good 0, Average +1, Damaged +3
+
+Past Flood Height: None 0, Below ankle +1, Knee-high +2, Waist-high +3
+
+Wind Speed:
+
+<60 km/h → +0
+
+60–100 → +1
+
+100–150 → +2
+
+150 → +3
+
+FINAL RISK LEVEL BASED ON TOTAL SCORE:
+
+0–4 → Low
+
+5–8 → Moderate
+
+9–12 → High
+
+13+ → Severe
+
+Each risk level must show specific, helpful text:
+
+Low: “Minimal risk. Keep monitoring weather updates.”
+
+Moderate: “Some risks detected. Secure loose items and stay alert.”
+
+High: “Significant risks present. Reinforce your home and prepare emergency items.”
+
+Severe: “Immediate danger. Prepare for evacuation and follow LGU instructions.”
+
+RECOMMENDATIONS SECTION
+Show a simple list:
+
+Secure rooftop and windows
+
+Charge devices and power banks
+
+Prepare emergency kit
+
+Monitor local weather alerts
+
+Avoid going outdoors during strong winds
+
+EDGE CASE HANDLING
+
+Show a warning if no house type is selected
+
+Prevent calculation if any required field is missing
+
+If wind speed is negative, show error
+
+If “None” hazard is selected, ignore other hazards
+
+AFTER BUILDING, RETURN:
+
+Summary of the entire user flow
+
+Summary of the scoring logic
+
+Confirm all inputs and outputs are connected
+
+Before generating, think about the optimal structure.
+Then build the cleanest, simplest version of this mini-app.
+```
+
+Generate an app logo and update the app metadata title and description.

+I want to add a simulation, for every risk level. 
+Make it so that the page is scrollable, and at the bottom of the screen(after the user fills up a form) there will be a simulation box, showcasing the windspind and the roof. Use React on this.
